The model training process includes:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for training.
Feature engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.
Model selection: Choosing the best machine learning algorithm.
Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model parameters for better performance.
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
